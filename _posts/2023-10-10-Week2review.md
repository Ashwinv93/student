## What We Did
- The second week we got our flask server running, and we launched our aws server. We also atempted to create the pack opening fucntion. 
- I personaly was in charge of creating and finding insperation for the front end, and I also used an online api to create a simple search "Pokedex" that allows a user to search for any pokemon they want, and get information about it.
- Next week we want to be compleated with the pack opening and creating 

## Issues

- One Big issue I faced, was how laggy the chrombooks are. Some times I had to send my code to my team member so they could commit it because my commits would just take to long, or break midway. It made everything alot slower, but I had to deal with it because I was using a chromebook.
