## Dante's Individual Review
## What I did
- For this project I feel like I did a significant amount of work on my project aswell as all of the other aspects. From the beggining I feel like i was in charge of a lot of the planning and making sure all of our ideas made sense and everything was completed. For my actual tangibles for the most recent project I worked on my individual feature, creating a database for all of the clash royale cards, making it so a user's favorite cards get added to a database, admin roles, aswell as some of the login and sign up. For my feature, I worked on displaying the cards from the backend in a way which would look nice. The user then has the ability to favorite any of the cards, but can only have 8 favorited at once. This acts as a form of favoriting cards/deck since the deck in the game can only hold 8 cards. For the databasef for the cards, I used to just use the card data hard coded in my front end, but using a csv file I created a database with all the cards and their unique data. This database would be used for both mine and Ashwin's feature. Next, I connected my front end favoriting code to a completely unique database where the user is able to add cards to the favorited database. Also, I worked heavily on the admin role. The night of our team teach I spent a long time making it so the user's cookie contains their role. Then I made a special page with all of the user data where only users with admin role can view the user database and ordinary users cannot and get hit with an error. Lastly, I worked on small features regarding the sign up and log in. 

## College board requirments
1. Instructions for input from one of the following: the user, a device, an online data stream, a file.	
- How I met this requirement: When the user is looking at the grid of cards they can flip the card over by clicking it and they can click teh favorite card button. The favorite card is then added to a unique database for favorited cards.
