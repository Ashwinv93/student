This week I had to set up my github acount and work with my other tools like Jupyter and vscode. I had alot of issues, and made alot of mistakes such as forking the repository wrong from the start, which caused me to lose alot of my progress. Before I had to restart, I was messing around with my blog by changing the theme, adding pictures and other cool things. I then had to make a new repository and copy what I could from the old one to the new files. After I did this, my “make” command suddenly stoped working due to a bundle install issue. After all of that, Jared baza my partner relized that there was a space in my config.yml file which was causing the make to time out. Now everything is in order and everything works!
