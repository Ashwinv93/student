1. Explaining:
 I felt like for my code I was able to explain all of my code accurately while being short concise. I did a lot of material including my feature, my feature backend, log in/ sign up, databases, and admin features. I felt I was able to explain this very well especially to people with very little experience in CSP and was able to answer questions from those with more experience. 
2. Tangibles:
I think my tangibles for night at the museum were extremely on point with me taking more a leadership role working on important aspects outside of my feature. I was able to show old versions of my features and my newest version and had everything working perfectly. Also, I was able to demonstrate the log in and sign up, the backend functionality, and the admin roles. I think I did especially well in this aspect since I stepped up for my group and worked on our foundations for our project outside of my feature. 
3. Preparation for event: 
Before the event I made sure I communicated with my group that I would be the only one commiting up until night at the museum since I did not want to potentially break our project. I made sure to have everything working in the front end and backend. Also, I went into my other's team members projects and briefly improved their functionality and appearance. Lastly, I was very clear with communicating my goals and showed up early to get everything ready.

1. Navigation and Formating: 
I think that the navigation of our project was pretty poor. I found myself often showing others how to navigate through the project and I think our project could've done with better navigation. Also, I think a homepage besides the timebox would've benefitted us aswell as instructions on the actual features. 
2. Planning:
 I think as a team our planning was pretty poor this caused me to have to do a code amount of work right before N@TM. I shoudl've demandedmy team mates code earlier to prevent myself from getting swamped with adding their features in last second. Also, I think overall, we could've planned our projects out since we were partly scrambling towards the middle and two of our members were missing a feature up until a couple days prior.
- ## Feedback: 
Some feedback I recieved/ noticed was especially for the poeple vieiwing the project that were not kids had no idea of what clash royale was. I was able to explain briefly what the game was, but they had very little understanding truly. I recieved feedback from one of the user's that the decks and card collection really dont serve a deeper purpose. I think it would've been cool to have some sort of a game related to Clash Royal. Lastly, som emore feedback was just easier navigation
