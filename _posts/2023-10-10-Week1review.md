## What We Did

- The first week was mostly just planning and understanding what we wanted to do, and how we would alocate our time. We decided on our theme of pokemon, and we decided we wanted to have a pack opening that would use an api to allow you to open a pokemon pack.
- I personaly was in charge of creating and finding insperation for the front end, and I also used an online api to create a simple search "Pokedex" that allows a user to search for any pokemon they want, and get information about it.
- Next week we want to get our backend and frontend linked, and get our api working.

## Issues

-Not many issues this week, because it was mostly planing, but while working on the search api, I had troble getting the front end to look good, so I used chat gpt to help me get it looking better.
