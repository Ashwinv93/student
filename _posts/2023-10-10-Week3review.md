## What we Did
This week we were getting ready to present at NOTM, and compleating our finishing touches. We were trying to add more information to the cards, while keeping a good frontend. This proved to be very diffucult

## Issues
Once of our biggest issues this week, was trying to change the theme of our website, which would just not work. There were several errors like, not having the correct layout files. Then replacing the files in the repo, would cause another error to show. By the end we did not have enought time to change our theme into somthing custom. Another of our issues, was adding pictures, on my chromebook, as alot of the times, they would not load at all.
